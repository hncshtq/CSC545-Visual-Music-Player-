This is where you initally start the song's play. You click the "Add songs" button, then select the song you would like played. The 

"Add songs" button defaults to the music folder. If the song desired isn't in the music folder, you will have to navigate to it's

that the song was added to the queue by again glancing to the top right corner. There you will see that the queue number has

OPTIONS MENU:

Beat sensitivity:
This option triggers the action of the effects. It governs the change of direction; the speed of the effect; and how often the 

effect is triggered.

Number of balls: 
This is where you decide the number of balls that will be drawn to the screen at one time.

Background:
The background can be selected by choosing the correct background listed:
a. none
	Background is all black. If effects are selected, they will be drawn over itself.

b. black
	The background is all black. All effects drawn will have a lighter color in order to see the effect in contrast with the 	

	dark background.

c. white
	The background is all white. All effects drawn will have a darker color in order to see the
	effect in contrast with the light background.

d. strobe
	This background starts in all black and switches to white and back. Giving the illusion of a strobe light effect.

e. disco
	This background starts with a disco print that moves from left to right, giving the effect of a disco hall.

Effects:
a. Bubbles
	This effect is circles in various diameters moving across the screen, then appear to bounce back into the opposite 		

	direction.

b. Explosions
	This effect has the bubbles but now have the illusion of breaking apart into smaller diameter circles

c. Waveform
	This effect is an abstract representation of the music signal in the illusion of a wave effect.

d. Infinite Mirror
	This effect is the mirror tunnel effect. It is one fully reflective mirror and one "one way" mirror, set up so that the 	

	one-way or partially reflective mirror reflects an image back onto the fully reflective mirror, in a recursive manner, 		

	creating a series of smaller and smaller reflections that recede into an infinite distance. 

e. Fill bubbles
	This effect is just as discribed. It fills the bubbles with their particular color.

Menu option instructions:
1) To set the beat sensitivity, type the desired number in the text field, hit the set button. Note: the smaller the number the     

  more actions will be performed.

2) To set the number of bubbles, type the desired number in the text field, then hit the set button. Note: smaller number of balls  

   are recommended for slower computers.

3) To set the background, just choose from choices. There can only be one background at a time.

4) To set the effects, just put a check in box of your choice. The unique thing about the effects are that they are stackable. For  

   instance, you can choose bubbles with explosions which will have bubbles all over the screen,and periodically explode according  

   to the beat sensitivity.

   Some cool effect combinations:
	1) Combining the "Infinite Mirror" effect and "Strobe" background results in an alternating black/white fading box effect.
	2) Combining the "Explosions" and "Infinite Mirror" effects will draw a color-changing border around the screen.
	3) In addition to filling the bubbles with their respective color, the "Fill Bubble" effect tints the background with a 	

           random color based on the beat.
	4) Selecting "None" for the background results in any current effects being drawn over each other; combining the effects    

           with "None" for the background can result in some very complex visuals.​
